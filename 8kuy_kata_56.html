        // TOTAL AMOUNT OF POINTS

        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* Our football team has finished the championship.
           Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings.
           Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.
           For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]
           Points are awarded for each match as follows:
                                          if x > y: 3 points (win)
                                          if x < y: 0 points (loss)
                                          if x = y: 1 point (tie)
           We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.  */
