        //   DESCRIPTION:
        /*   Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each.
             If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
             Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't. */

        function loveFunc(flower1, flower2) {
            return (flower1 + flower2) % 2 !== 0
        }

        console.log(loveFunc(10, 10));   // false
        console.log(loveFunc(11, 11));   // false
        console.log(loveFunc(10, 11));   // true


        // second version:
        function loveFunc2(flower1, flower2) {
            return flower1 % 2 !== flower2 % 2;
        }

        console.log(loveFunc2(10, 10));   // false
