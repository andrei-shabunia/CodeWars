        // FIND THE ODD INT


        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.
           There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
           Examples:
                     [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
                     [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
                     [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
                     [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
                     [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).       */

        // first edition:
        function findOdd(num) {
            let res = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < num.length; j++) {
                    if (num[i] === num[j]) {
                        res += 1;
                    }
                }
                if (res % 2 !== 0) {
                    return num[i];
                }
            }
        }

        let abc = [1, 2, 5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 1]; // 5
        console.log(findOdd(abc));

        // second version
        const findOdd2 = (xs) => xs.reduce((a, b) => a ^ b);
