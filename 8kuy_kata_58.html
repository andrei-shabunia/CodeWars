        // TRANSPORTATION ON VACATION

        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation.
           So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.
           You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation.
           The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.
           Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total.
           Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
           Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).  */

        function rentalCarCost(d) {
            if (d >= 7) {
                return 40 * d - 50;
            } else if (d >= 3) {
                return 40 * d - 20;
            } else {
                return 40 * d;
            }
        }

        // second version:

            if (d < 3) return d * 40;
            if (7 > d && d >= 3) return (d * 40 - 20);
            if (d >= 7) return (d * 40 - 50);

            let dayCost = 40;
            let discount = 0;
            if (days >= 3) discount += 20;
            if (days >= 7) discount += 30;
