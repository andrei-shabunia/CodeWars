        // REMOVE FIRST AND LAST CHARACTER

        // DESCRIPTION:
        // It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
        // You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

        function removeChar(str) {
            return str.substring(1, str.length - 1);
        }

        console.log(removeChar("America"));  // meric
