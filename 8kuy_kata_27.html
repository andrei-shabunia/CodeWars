        // IS N DIVISIBLE BY X AND Y?

        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y.
           All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.
           Examples:
                    1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
                    2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
                    3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
                    4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5       */

        // first version:
        function isDivisible(n, x, y) {
            return (n % x === 0 && n % y === 0);
        }

        console.log(isDivisible(3, 1, 3));   // true
        console.log(isDivisible(12, 2, 6));  // true
        console.log(isDivisible(100, 5, 3)); // false
        console.log(isDivisible(12, 7, 5));  // false
