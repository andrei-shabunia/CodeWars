        // YOU'RE A SQUARE!

        //   DESCRIPTION:
        /* A square of squares
           You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
           And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
           However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square.
           Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things!
           If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait!
           That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
           Task:
           Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
           In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
           The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages. */

                return false;

        console.log(isSquare2(7));  // false
        console.log(isSquare2(25)); // true

        // first version:

            return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(number));

        function isSquare3(n) {
            return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0;
