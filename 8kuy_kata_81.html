        // COUNT THE MONKEYS!

        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys.
           You know that there are a certain number there (n),
           but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.
           As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n),
           populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

           For example(Input --> Output):
                                         10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
                                         1 --> [1]                                         */


        // first version:
        function monkeyCount(n) {
            let result = [];
            for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                result.push(i);
            }
            return result;
        }

        // second version:
        function monkeyCount2(n) {
            return [...Array(n).keys()].map(a => a + 1)
        }
